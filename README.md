# Human Activity Recognition by Echo State Network
The scripts main_LIESN.m, main_EuSN, main_1DCONV.m and main_GRU.m, perform the grid search and evaluate rispectively the Leaky Integrator-Echo State Network (LI-ESN), Euler State Network (EuSN), Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures on the test set.
The script realtime_LIESN.m predict the output of a heterogeneous signal, in a real-time simulation.
